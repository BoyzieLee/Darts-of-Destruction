##Mockup Details
Take a look at this mockup and follow along with the numbers below:

1) This is the company name & logo. Feel free to just grab an icon from The Noun Project or elsewhere to use for a logo and come up with a cool sounding company name. Think "trendy" but not "too trendy".

2) We need to show some images of lawn darts in action to our customers. Unfortunately, the feds seized all of our photos, so you'll need to find some on your own! Also, we'd like this to rotate between photos (either automatically or manually) so the users can see as many as possible. Honestly though 3-5 will do.

3) Basic title and description. This is in the data provided.

4) Action Buttons! First we have the Add to Cart button. When this is clicked, we want a popup to appear with a message saying the item was added to the cart. We provided that in the Modal mockup below. Secondly, we need you to add in some social icons for users to be able to share our page with the world. We think Twitter, Facebook and Pinterest should suffice, but feel free to add others.

5) These are our client testimonials. Again, we have data written up for you, but no images. To be fair, we "made" up these testimonials ourselves and we need you to find some random pictures of people.

6) These icons are provided. Just display them

7) We are not aloud to disclose the location of our "old" warehouse, so just pick some nice sounding place to make our customers feel warm and fuzzy inside. Please also use Google Maps for this. No need to get real deep in their API, just use the embeddable map they provide.

8) Eh, it's a Footer. Throw a copyright here and anything else that makes sense.

##Requirements
Almost all the data (unless otherwise noted) needs to be pulled in via ajax.
The website must be responsive. You can use a framework to help you achieve this.
